The paper proposed a novel neural network architecture based entirely on\\nattention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. This\\narchitecture became the foundation for modern language models including BERT, GPT,\\nT5, and many others.\\nIntroduction\\nBefore the Transformer, sequence-to-sequence models relied heavily on recurrent neural\\nnetworks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These architectures had\\nseveral limitations: RNNs processed sequences sequentially, making parallelization\\ndifficult, while CNNs required multiple layers to capture long-range dependencies. The\\nTransformer architecture addressed these issues by using self-attention mechanisms that\\ncould process all positions in a sequence simultaneously.\\nKey Innovation: Self-Attention Mechanism\\nThe core innovation of the Transformer is the self-attention mechanism, also known as\\nscaled dot-product attention. This mechanism allows each position in a sequence to attend\\nto all positions in the input sequence. The attention function can be described as mapping\\na query and a set of key-value pairs to an output, where the query, keys, values, and\\noutput are all vectors. The scaled dot-product attention is computed as: Attention(Q, K, V)\\n= softmax(QK^T / √d_k)V Where Q, K, and V represent the query, key, and value matrices\\nrespectively, and d_k is the dimension of the keys.\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function, the Transformer uses multi-head\\nattention, which runs multiple attention mechanisms in parallel. Each \"head\" learns\\ndifferent types of relationships between words. The outputs of all heads are concatenated\\nand linearly transformed to produce the final output. Multi-head attention allows the model\\nto jointly attend to information from different representation subspaces at different\\npositions. This is crucial for understanding complex relationships in language, such as\\nsyntactic and semantic dependencies.'),\n",

Parallelization: Unlike RNNs, all positions can be processed simultaneously, enabling\\nmuch faster training. 2. Long-range Dependencies: Direct connections between any two\\npositions in the sequence through attention. 3. Interpretability: Attention weights provide\\ninsight into which parts of the input the model focuses on. 4. Scalability: The architecture\\nscales well with increased model size and data. 5. Transfer Learning: Pre-trained\\nTransformers can be fine-tuned for various downstream tasks effectively.\\nImpact and Modern Applications\\nThe Transformer architecture has had profound impact on the field of natural language\\nprocessing and beyond: Language Models: \\x7f BERT (Bidirectional Encoder\\nRepresentations from Transformers) \\x7f GPT series (Generative Pre-trained Transformers) \\x7f\\nT5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer) \\x7f RoBERTa, ELECTRA, DeBERTa, and many\\nothers Computer Vision: \\x7f Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification \\x7f DETR\\n(Detection Transformer) for object detection \\x7f Swin Transformer for various vision tasks\\nMultimodal Applications: \\x7f CLIP for vision-language understanding \\x7f DALL-E for\\ntext-to-image generation \\x7f Flamingo for few-shot learning across modalities Other\\nDomains: \\x7f Protein folding prediction (AlphaFold2) \\x7f Code generation (GitHub Copilot) \\x7f\\nScientific research and discovery\\nTechnical Implementation Details\\nModel Dimensions: \\x7f Model dimension (d_model): 512 \\x7f Feed-forward dimension: 2048 \\x7f\\nNumber of attention heads: 8 \\x7f Number of encoder/decoder layers: 6 Training Details: \\x7f\\nOptimizer: Adam with custom learning rate scheduling \\x7f Warmup steps: 4,000 \\x7f Dropout:\\n0.1 applied to attention weights and feed-forward outputs \\x7f Label smoothing: 0.1\\nComputational Complexity: The self-attention mechanism has O(n²d) complexity where\\nn is sequence length and d is model dimension.

      "Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [13] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks\n",
      "in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\n",
      "transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [35, 2, 5]. Numerous\n",
      "efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\n",
      "architectures [38, 24, 15].\n",
      "Recurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\n",
      "sequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\n",
      "states ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\n",
      "sequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\n",
      "sequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\n",
      "significant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\n",
      "computation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\n",
      "constraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\n",
      "Attention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\n",
      "tion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\n",
      "the input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\n",
      "are used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\n",
      "In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\n",
      "relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\n",
      "The Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\n",
      "translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Background\n",
      "The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\n",
      "[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\n",
      "block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\n",
      "the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\n",
      "in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\n",
      "it more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\n",
      "reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\n",
      "to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\n",
      "described in section 3.2.\n",
      "Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\n",
      "of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\n",
      "used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\n",
      "textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\n",
      "End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\n",
      "aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\n",
      "language modeling tasks [34].\n",
      "To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\n",
      "entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\n",
      "aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\n",
      "self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\n",
      "3\n",
      "Model Architecture\n",
      "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\n",
      "Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\n",
      "of continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\n",
      "sequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\n",
      "[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",
      "2\n",
      "Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\n",
      "The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",
      "connected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\n",
      "respectively.\n",
      "3.1\n",
      "Encoder and Decoder Stacks\n",
      "Encoder:\n",
      "The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\n",
      "sub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\n",
      "wise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\n",
      "the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\n",
      "LayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\n",
      "itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\n",
      "layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\n",
      "Decoder:\n",
      "The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\n",
      "sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\n",
      "attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\n",
      "around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\n",
      "sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\n",
      "masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
      "predictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n",

      "Attention\n",
      "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",

The company raised US$2 million in 2018 to build a platform to deploy machine learning models at scale inside multimedia applications.\\nIn December 2020, Runway raised US$8.5 million in a Series A funding round.\\nIn December 2021, the company raised US$35 million in a Series B funding round.\\nIn August 2022, the company co-released an improved version of their Latent Diffusion Model called Stable Diffusion together with the CompVis Group at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and a compute donation by Stability AI.\\nOn December 21, 2022, Runway raised US$50 million in a Series C round. Followed by a $141 million Series C extension round in June 2023 at a $1.5 billion valuation from Google, Nvidia, and Salesforce to build foundational multimodal AI models for content generation to be used in films and video production.\\nIn February 2023 Runway released Gen-1 and Gen-2 the first commercial and publicly available foundational video-to-video and text-to-video generation model accessible via a simple web interface.\\nIn June 2023 Runway was selected as one of the 100 Most Influential Companies in the world by Time magazine.\\nOn 3 April 2025, Runway raised $308 million in a funding round led by General Atlantic, valuing it at over $3 billion.\\n\\n\\n== Services and technologies ==\\nRunway is focused on generative AI for video, media, and art. The company focuses on developing proprietary foundational model technology that professionals in filmmaking, post-production, advertising, editing, and visual effects can utilize. Additionally, Runway offers an iOS app aimed at consumers.\\nThe Runway product is accessible via a web platform and through an API as a managed service.\\n\\n\\n=== Stable Diffusion ===\\nStable Diffusion is an open-source deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022 based on the original paper High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models published by Runway and the CompVis Group at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Stable Diffusion is mostly used to create images conditioned on text descriptions.\\n\\n\\n=== Gen-1 ===\\nGen-1 is a video-to-video generative AI system that synthesize new videos by applying the composition and style of an image or text prompt to the structure of a source video. The model was released in February 2023. The Gen-1 model was trained and developed by Runway based on the original paper Structure and Content-Guided Video Synthesis with Diffusion Models from Runway Research. Gen-1 is an example of generative artificial intelligence for video creation.\\n\\n\\n=== Gen-2 ===\\nGen-2 is a multimodal AI system that can generate novel videos with text, images or video clips. The model is a continuation of Gen-1 and includes a modality to generate video conditioned to text. Gen-2 is one of the first commercially available text-to-video models.\\n\\n\\n=== Gen-3 Alpha ===\\nGen-3 Alpha is the first of an upcoming series of models trained by Runway on a new infrastructure built for large-scale multimodal training. It is a major improvement in fidelity, consistency, and moti\")]"
